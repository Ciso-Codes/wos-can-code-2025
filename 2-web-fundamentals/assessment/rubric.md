# Web Fundamentals Assessment: Understanding the Rubric

This rubric outlines the criteria for your Web Fundamentals assessment. It breaks down the requirements for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into specific measurable items. Use this to guide your work and understand how your project will be evaluated.

## Assessment Goal:

To demonstrate your ability to create a fully functioning web page using foundational HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This includes structuring semantic and accessible markup, implementing a Flexbox-based layout, and using JavaScript to add interactivity through event handling and DOM manipulation.
