## Review Guide

Use this guide to make sure you're ready for the Web Fundamentals assessment. The following checklist covers the technical topics, file setup, and best practices you should confirm before you begin. If you're feeling stuck or unsure during the exam, come back to this page for a quick reset!

1.  **Major Concepts:**
    - HTML topics (e.g. heading hierarchy, valid structure, labels + inputs)
    - CSS topics (Flexbox, external stylesheet, avoiding misuse of `position`)
    - JavaScript topics (event listeners, DOM manipulation basics, swapping content)
    - Code quality (indentation, comments, meaningful variable and function names)
2.  **Before You Begin:**
    - Make sure you're working in the correct folder
    - Double check that all required files are present
3.  **Helpful Reminders:**
    - **Take a deep breath** — you’ve been learning and practicing these skills every day. You know more than you think!
    - Use DevTools for inspecting layout, checking console output, and debugging JavaScript
    - Use comments to help organize and explain your code
    - Check for spelling, casing, and capitalization mismatches (especially for class names, \`id\`s, or file paths)
    - If you’re stuck, revisit a working past assignment for reference — but don’t copy and paste blindly
    - Take a short break if you hit a wall — stepping away can reset your thinking
    - **Remember:** You can ask your instructors for help if you get stuck. We can’t give you the answers, but we can **point you in the right direction** . There’s no penalty for asking a question.
4.  **Before You Submit:**
    - Validate your HTML and CSS (e.g. [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/))
    - **Check the Rubric**: Before you submit your assessment, take a moment to **review the rubric carefully** (on the next page). Use it as a checklist to ensure you've addressed all requirements and best practices. This will help you catch any last-minute details!
